# T1A3 Assignment


1. Project Description: Start with a brief overview of your project, including its purpose, functionality, and any relevant features. I have built a terminal application that runs a game of uno. This game is run for between 1 and 4 players. The game is finished when the player has discarded all the cards in their hand. If a player has not then they will pick up more.

2. Installation: 

1. Open the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac or Linux)
2. Navigate to directory containing T1A3.py
3. Run file on command prompt using --> python T1A3.py


3. This game of uno can be played with up to 4 people, meaning you can play a game of uno with your friends if you are bored.
